  Please see the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

  This is the first game I've written for X from "scratch" (the
graphics interface is borrowed, I wrote everything else), but is by no
means my first game.  I have written several popular shareware games
for the Amiga, and plan to start porting them to X.  This project is
to help me get used to X and to fine tune the graphics routines to
make the next project easier.

  Previous versions of this game were released as shareware.  However,
it was never really worth my while.  Therefore, with apologies to the
good souls that sent their payments in, I have placed it under the GNU
GPL.  See COPYING for details

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
