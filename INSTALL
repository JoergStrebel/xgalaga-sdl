Packages for rpm based distributions have similar names.

Most people should be able to do:
  autoreconf -i
  ./configure
  make

As root,
  make install

or if your system supports sudo:
  sudo make install

And play with:
  xgalaga-sdl

If you do not want install the game, you can run it in place:
  ./configure --datadir=`pwd`
and start it with:
  src/xgalaga-sdl
